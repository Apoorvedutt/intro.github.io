          <h2>AN ENGINEER</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mechanical engineers</b> are involved in the design, manufacture,
            inspection and maintenance of machinery, equipment and components
            such as vehicles, engines, aerospace products, weapon systems,
            robotics, turbines, construction and farm machinery, as well as a
            wide range of tools and devices. This type of engineering is also
            associated with the management of control systems and instruments
            for measuring the performance and status of machinery. Engineering
            has been a part of human history, in one form or another, for
            thousands of years. Of course, as our knowledge and understanding of
            science and mathematics grew, so our engineering expertise and
            competence also improved. Todayâ€™s engineers use the most advanced
            technologies, alongside established scientific principles, to apply
            cutting-edge solutions and innovation to real world challenges. It
            is hard to over-emphasise the importance of engineering on human
            history, from designing transportation systems to powering our
            homes, engineering is all around us, right down to the device you
            are using to read this. As our scientific knowledge continues to
            advance, so engineering will find ways to take this new information
            and apply it to the world around us.
